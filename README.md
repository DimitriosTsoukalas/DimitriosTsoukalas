- 👋 Hi, This is Dimitrios and here there are few lines about me and what you can find here.
- 👀 Since I was young I was really into technology & gaming. Back then it was really hard to have a powerful hardware of course but still I was able to get the job done. I am here becase I want to share my portfolio with anyone out there - Python & Unity are my passions 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Unity along with some C# scripting - pretty tough one but I am getting there ~
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on potential small projects if possible (really into pixel art gaming, text mining and data analytics).
- 📫 How to reach me? Easy, send me an email at uomwave91@hotmail.com
