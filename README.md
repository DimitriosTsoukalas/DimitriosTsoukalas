- 👋 Hi, This is Dimitrios and here there are few lines about me and what you can find here.
- 👀 Since I was young I was really into technology & gaming. Back then it was really hard to have a powerful hardware of course but the job was being done whatsoever. I am here becase I want to share my portfolio with anyone out there - Python & Unity lately have been my passions. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Unity along with some C# scripting - pretty tough one but I am getting there
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on potential small projects if possible - really into pixel art games / pixelated animation and more.
- 📫 How to reach me? Easy, send me an email at uomwave91@hotmail.com
